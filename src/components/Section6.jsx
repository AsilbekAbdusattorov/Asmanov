        <p className="text-2xl text-center mb-10">My parents were visiting from out of town and my father <br /> mentioned
        severe tooth pain so we called and got an appt for <br /> early the next
        morning. </p>
        <p className="text-2xl text-center mb-5">Dr. Kamali and the entire staff were incredibly kind and <br /> professional to my father who was very nervous they would  <br />lecture or judge him based on the state of the tooth. They <br /> made him comfortable and worked swiftly to relieve his pain. <br /> Thank you!</p>
